Liblayout is a library for creating button layouts using specified bounding
boxes and an arbitrary amount of buttons. The buttons are positioned in
the box with respect to the  aspect ratio of the bounding box. For instance,
a box of 640x480 has an aspect ratio of 4:3. This means that if you have 12
buttons you will get 3 rows of 4 buttons.

See layout.h for function declarations and information.
