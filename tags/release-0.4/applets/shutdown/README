1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shutdown widget is a very simple application that shows a dialog window
with configurable buttons specifying the action to be taken. The reason it
is called the "shutdown" widget is because it was developed to provide the
user with different "shutdown" options after pressing the "shutdown" button
from the gappman interface. (if specified in gappman ofcourse).

The "shutdown" widget may be used for other actions besides shutdown actions.
It is fully configurable through using XML as specified by libparseconf.
It uses the <action> block to configure the buttons.

2. Running the application
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program can be executed as follows from the source tarball after building it:

./shutdown --conffile xml-config-files/shutdown.xml

Use --help to get information on more supported options.

3. XML Configuration file format
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The layout is defined in XML configuration files which are parsed by 
libparseconf see the README in libs/parseconf for more details.
