   * Redraw layout when screen resolution changes for gappman. Probably more efficient to not change layout when resolutio changes on behalf of a started program.
   * Add a Weather applet.
   * Add a News applet.
   * Add a System health applet.
   * Add dynamic fontsize recalculation when menu gets too big. Now fontsize is calculated based on programs buttonbox. This fontsize might be too big for instance for changeresolution applet to show for all possible screen resolutions.
   * Add support for scrollbars when menu is too big for layout.
   * Implement support for keybindings. For instance to start specific applets.
