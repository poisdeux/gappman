#summary The main program

= Introduction =

Gappman creates and manages the main User Interface (UI).
It runs as a daemon listening to requests from applets/widgets and
starts applications.

The idea is that gappman calculates the best setup for the UI and
draws and places the buttons on the screen to provide an evenly spaced
layout. It tracks started applications and provides applets with details 
about the UI layout and started applications.
