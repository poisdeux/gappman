3. Using the application
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changeresolution will show the available resolutions on startup. When a 
resolution is selected it will become effective immediately.
The user will be presented with a new dialog asking
on what the resolution should apply:

Set the resolution as default for a program managed by gappman
Keep the resolution for now
Cancel the resolution and revert back to the previous resolution

When the user chooses to set the resolution as default for a specific program
he/she will be presented with a new dialog window showing the known programs.
The user can select a specific program. This will make changeresolution 
send the resolution change to gappman. Next time the program is started it
will use the new resolution.
