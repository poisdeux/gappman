GAppMan should be able to manage window stacking. At least to bring its
own window to the top of the stack.

We can use gtk_window_present(GtkWindow *window) to bring window to top
of the window stack.

Issues:

   * How to manage windows for external started applications
   * Should GAppMan trigger on keybinding or d-bus/socket message? Or both?
