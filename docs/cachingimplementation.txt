Large high resolution images take a lot of CPU processing to scale.
This results in significant delays when the widget/application is started.
To speed up the process caching of the scaled image can result in 
much faster startup times.

This would require a new attribute: <cachelocation> specifying
a location on disk where the cached files are put.
Cached version of the images should conform to the following
naming scheme:

APPNAME-BUTTONNAME-WIDTHxHEIGHT

The WIDTH and HEIGHT should be the max width and height as passed
to the function load_image in layout.c.

The load_image function first looks in the <cachelocation> directory
if a file conforming to the naming scheme exists. If so, it will load
this file and will not perform any scaling. If it cannot find the file
it will load the original <logo> and scale it. 

If the <cachelocation> attribute is not specified caching should be
disabled.
