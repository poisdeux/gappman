# Introduction #

The ChangeResolution applet allows you to change the screen resolution using the XRandR support of the Xorg (Window Manager).

The main screen will show the current resolution and all supported resolutions:

When you select a resolution you get the following options to set the resolution
as default for a specific program or just keep the new resolution as current resolution
or return to the main screen:

When setting the resolution as default for a specific program you get an overview of
available programs:

Clicking on the program's button will set the resolution as default by notifying GAppMan
of the change. Note that it depends on GAppMan if this change will be made permanent or only
be effective for the current session.
