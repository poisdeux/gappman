1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The processmanager widget provides a GUI to send signals to processes started
by gappman. It connects to the gappman listener and requests a list of started
processes and their status. This list is used to generate a dialog which
shows the process with its status. The user can select a process and 
processmanager will give the user the ability to stop the process.

Stopping a process is accomplished using a sequence of signals. First it will
try to stop the process by sending it the SIGTERM signal. If the process does
not respond it will send a SIGKILL signal.

A special case is when the process to be stopped is in a zombie state. This
means that we will need to kill the parent which will be gappman itself.
Instead of killing gappman a restart will be tried.

2. Running the application
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program can be executed as follows from the source tarball after building it:

./processmanager [servername] [port] 

Use --help to get information on more supported options.

The gappmanxmlconfigurationfile is needed to get the images used for the buttons
to start the applications.
