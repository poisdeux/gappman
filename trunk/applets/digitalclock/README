We calculate every second the digits for hours and minutes.
Is this expensive? Should we only do this when the digit 
actually changes? Is an if-statement cheaper?

== Drawing Digits ==

A digit consists of the following 7 elements:

 0
1 2
 3
4 5
 6
Depending on the number that must be shown one or more
of the elements are turned on while the others are
turned off.

0: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
1: 2, 5
2: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
3: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
4: 1, 2, 3, 5
5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
7: 0, 2, 5
8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
