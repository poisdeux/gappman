== TODO ==

Add support for images to use as bars instead of drawing them.

== Drawing Digits ==

A digit consists of the following 7 elements:

 0
1 2
 3
4 5
 6
Depending on the number that must be shown one or more
of the elements are turned on while the others are
turned off.

0: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
1: 2, 5
2: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
3: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
4: 1, 2, 3, 5
5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
7: 0, 2, 5
8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

== Drawing date ==

The date drawing is performed using the same digits.

We will need to support drawing letters as well
as we would like to show dates as follows:

zo 13 nov 2011

All letters will be uppercase.

The letters A - J, L, N - P, S, U, Z can be represented by a single digit.
The digits will need to be extended to include diagonal bars
as well to support the letters K, M, Q, R.
K, Q, and R will require a single digit.
M, T, V, W, X, Y will require two digits.
