* Be able to restart network (dhclient)

* Be able to popup main menu when other apps have focus

* Grouping. This would enable different layouts for different groups of buttons and/or widgets

* Keybindings to specific widgets. This would make it possible to have widgets pop-up when for instance watching a movie.

* Fix header includes. layout.h cannot include ../parseconf/parseconf.h as the program including layout.h will not be able to find ../parseconf/parseconf.h. So now each program including layout.h first needs to include parseconf.h

* Fix fontsize calculation. This is now performed by gm_create_buttonbox but should be done only once. Preferrably only when the programs-button_box is calculated.

* Redesign netman

* Unit-testing with http://klee.llvm.org/
