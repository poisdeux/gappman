1. Library versionnumbering
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use libtool library version mechanism which works with current, revision,
and age values. These are specified in the "-version-info" option which is
added to a library's LDFLAGS (see Makefile.am for the library).

The "current" value represents the interface version number. This number
changes when the public interface of the library changes.

The "revision" value is changed when the library changed but the public
interface remains the same.

The "age" value represents the number of previous versions that are still 
supported. For instance, if you add a new function the "current" version
increases by one and so does the "age" value. Indicating that the new
version is backwards compatible with the previous version.

The following algorithm can be used to determine the new libtool version:

1. If the library source code has changed increment "revision" by one

2. If the public interface has changed increment "current" by one and set
   "revision" to 0.

3. If the public interface contains new functions since the previous version 
   increment "age"

4. If functions have been removed from the public interface since the 
   previous version set "age" to 0.

NOTE: only update the version(s) when you are about to create a new public
      release. This should minimize the amount of version changes and keep
      the versionnumbers low.
