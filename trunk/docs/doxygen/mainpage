 * \section Introduction
 * 
 * This is an application launcher utility that uses a XML configuration file to
 * specify the applications and logo images which should be included in the
 * menu. The menu is automatically created by scaling and placing the buttons to 
 * provide an evenly spaced layout.
 * 
 * This is very convenient when developing applications for heterogeneous platforms
 * where the display size may vary considerably, e.g. mobile devices, HD 
 * television screens, computer screens.
 * 
 * \subsection Features
 * 
 * - Automatic scaling and placing of buttons
 * - Supports two types of buttons; actions and programs. Here, action means starting a management application like configuring the X server, restarting the system, setting up network, etc.. Programs are applications which fullfill the actual purpose of the system. E.g. mediaplayer, remote desktop, webbrowsing, etc. etc..
 * - Supports applets as modules which are dynamically loaded by gappman
 * - Change screen resolution when a program is started and change it back to original when program quits.
 * - Fully configurable using XML configuration files.
 * - Image caching for fast loading of scaled images.
 * 
 * Wishlist 
 * - Major features for release 1.0
 *  - Redraw layout when screen resolution changes for gappman. Probably more efficient to not change layout when resolutio changes on behalf of a started program.
 *  - Applets
 *   - Weather applet.
 *   - News applet.
 *   - System health applet.
 *  - Dynamic font recalculation when menu gets too big. Now fontsize is calculated based on programs buttonbox. This fontsize might be too big for instance for changeresolution applet to show for all possible screen resolutions.
 *  - Add support for scrollbars when menu is too big for layout.
 *  - Implement support for keybindings. For instance to start specific applets.
 *  - Startup indication. When program is started button should show program is starting up.
 *  - Unit-testing with http://klee.llvm.org/
 * - Minor features
 *  - Be able to popup main menu when other apps have focus. This should probably be solved in the window manager used and not solved by gappman.
 *  - Applet changeresolution
 *   - show current resolution
 *   - add button to keep selected resolution
 *  - Applet netman
 *   - Implement support for network unavailability when no network-interfaces have been configured.
 *   - Implement support for keybindings which should trigger the menu to pop-up.
