 * \section Introduction
 * 
 * This is an application launcher utility that uses a XML configuration file to
 * specify the applications and logo images which should be included in the
 * menu. The menu is automatically created by scaling and placing the buttons to 
 * provide an evenly spaced layout.
 * 
 * This is very convenient when developing applications for heterogeneous platforms
 * where the display size may vary considerably, e.g. mobile devices, HD 
 * television screens, computer screens.
 * 
 * \subsection Features
 * 
 * - Automatic scaling and placing of buttons
 * - Supports two types of buttons; actions and programs. Here, action means starting a management application like configuring the X server, restarting the system, setting up network, etc.. Programs are applications which fullfill the actual purpose of the system. E.g. mediaplayer, remote desktop, webbrowsing, etc. etc..
 * - Supports applets as modules which are dynamically loaded by gappman
 * - Change screen resolution when a program is started and change it back to original when program quits.
 * - Fully configurable using XML configuration files.
 * - Image caching for fast loading of scaled images.
