Alignment values can be "top", "center", "bottom", "left", and "right".

top aligned elements should be added to hbox_top.
bottom aligned elements should be added to hbox_bottom.
center aligned elements should be added to hbox_middle if none of top or bottom is defined
as alignment.

Within the corresponding hbox the alignment will be either left, center, or right.

The width and height of the hboxes are not fixed but will grow or shrink based
on the button sizes.
