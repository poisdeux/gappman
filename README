1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an application launcher utility that uses a XML configuration file
to specify the applications and logo images which should be included in
the menu. The menu is automatically created by scaling and placing the
buttons to provide an evenly spaced layout.

This is very convenient when developing applications for heterogeneous
platforms where the display size may vary considerably, e.g. mobile
devices, HD television screens, computer screens.

Features:

* Automatic scaling and placing of buttons

* Supports two types of buttons; actions and programs. Here, action
means starting a management application like configuring the X server,
restarting the system, setting up network, etc.. Programs are applications
which fullfill the actual purpose of the system. E.g. mediaplayer,
remote desktop, webbrowsing, etc. etc..

* Supports applets as modules which are dynamically loaded by gappman

* Change screen resolution when a program is started and change it back
to original when program quits.

* Fully configurable using XML configuration files.

* Image caching for fast loading of scaled images.

2. Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tarball version can be build as follows:

	./configure make && make install

When you want to build the SVN version you will first need to create
the configure script:

  libtoolize
  cd libs
  libtoolize
  cd ..
  autoreconf -vif

Now you should be able to build appmanager as usual:

  ./configure 
  make

Installing gappman is done as follows:

  make install

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Running the application
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program can be executed as follows from the source tarball after
building it:

appmanager/gappman --conffile xml-config-files/conf.xml --gtkrc gtk-config/gtkrc

This will start appmanager using the sample configuration file
in "xml-config-files/conf.xml" and the gtk configuration file
"gtk-config/gtkrc".  Note that the gtkrc file is optional but some
actions defined in "conf.xml" use it. So to get a consistent UI-layout
it is nice to use it.

Use --help to get information on more supported options.

4. XML Configuration file format
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The layout is defined in XML configuration files which are parsed by
libparseconf see the README in libs/parseconf for more details.
